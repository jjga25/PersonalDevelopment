__[Game Programmer Intern | Epic](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/careers/jobs/5661819004)__
* A programming opportunity from a company that I know using a language that I know
* Though I know and am able to use C++, I should definitely familiarize myself with more than just the basics since they are looking for strong knowledge of it. I should also familiarize myself with the Unreal Engine since I don't have any coding experience on it. 

__[Gameplay System Intern | Epic](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/careers/jobs/5661819004)__
* Like before, though I know and am able to use C++, I should definitely familiarize myself with more than just the basics since they are looking for strong knowledge of it. I should also familiarize myself with the Unreal Engine since I don't have any coding experience on it. If genuinely considering the opportunity, should consider looking into what blueprint skills are when it comes to programming.

__[Game Developer Intern | Keybridge Technologies](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/careers/jobs/5661819004)__
* Requires at least a year of experience with Unity, C#, and C++
* Like before, though I know and am able to use C++, I should definitely familiarize myself with more than just the basics since they are looking for strong knowledge of it. I should also look into the source code of Unity more and experiment more with the engine. I should also work with simulating physics since it is a skill that is desired.
